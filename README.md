# COVID-19-selt-test
A GADS2020 Community Project

Project name: COVID-19 SELF TEST

Project idea: Creating a COVID self test app that would help users answer a set of questions and based on those questions the app gives a remark to the user whether he or she is affected. And a part where a user can also input several symptoms he or she is facing and the app would predict if the user has COVID
